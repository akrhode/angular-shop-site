# angular-shop-site

Single-page online shop built with Angular and Tailwind CSS to practice using Angular's HTTP API, the HttpClient service class. Product data is accessed from the free public FakeStoreAPI (https://fakestoreapi.com/). UI components are built using Angular Material.

Users can change the format of the displayed product cards and sort products by number per page, category, and descending/ascending order. Upon adding products to the cart, users can view the cart's content and the total price. The number of units in the cart can be increased/decreased and products can be added/removed.
